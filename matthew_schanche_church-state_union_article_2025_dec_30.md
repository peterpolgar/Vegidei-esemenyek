# The Image to the Beast: America's (Trump's) Faith Initiatives Provide More Evidence That The Church-State Union Is Happening Now

Author: **Matthew Schanche**

Date: **Dec 30, 2025**

---

Revelation 13 prophesies that a second beast, the United States of America, would arise with lamblike appearance (religious liberty, civil freedom) but eventually speak as a dragon (persecution, enforcement). This beast would create an "image to the beast," meaning it would replicate the union of church and state power that characterized papal Rome. The Trump administration has launched four major faith initiatives:

1. the "America Prays" program,
2. the White House Faith Office under Paula White-Cain,
3. the Religious Liberty Commission
4. the Task Force to Eradicate "Anti-Christian Bias"

These four initiatives represent concrete steps toward this prophesied church-state union. Let's examine each initiative through the lens of biblical prophecy and the inspired writings of Ellen G. White, to demonstrate how these programs, despite appearing to support religious freedom, actually lay the groundwork for the enforcement mechanisms that will characterize the final crisis. The establishment of governmental offices promoting specific religious practices, the appointment of prosperity gospel advocates to positions of spiritual authority over the nation, and the creation of task forces to combat broadly-defined "bias" against Christianity all fulfill the prophetic warning that America would repudiate its founding principles and enforce religious conformity through civil power.

## I. Initiative #1: The "America Prays" Program

### What It Is

The "America Prays" program was established as a White House initiative to promote coordinated national prayer, particularly during crises. The program encourages Americans to pray at specific times for the nation, often coordinated with presidential statements or national emergencies.

**Key features:**

- Government-promoted prayer times
- Presidential involvement in religious activities
- Official White House endorsement of specific religious practices
- Coordination with religious leaders for national prayer events

### Why This Violates the Church-State Separation Principle

**The First Amendment:**

> "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

The Establishment Clause was designed to prevent exactly this kind of governmental involvement in religious practice. When government promotes, coordinates, or endorses specific religious activities, it crosses the line from protecting religious liberty to establishing religion.

**The distinction is critical:**

- **Protecting the right to pray** = legitimate government role
- **Promoting when, how, and what to pray** = establishment of religion

"America Prays" does the latter. It is government using its authority to encourage specific religious practices.

### The Prophetic Significance

Ellen G. White warned precisely about this development:

> "But what is the “image to the beast”? and how is it to be formed? ... we must study the characteristics of the beast itself,—the papacy. When the early church became corrupted by departing from the simplicity of the gospel, and accepting heathen rites and customs, she lost the Spirit and power of God; and in order to control the consciences of the people she sought the support of the secular power. The result was the papacy, a church that controlled the power of the State, and employed it to further her own ends, especially for the punishment of “heresy.” In order for the United States to form an image of the beast, the religious power must so control the civil government that the authority of the State will also be employed by the church to accomplish her own ends. GC88 443.2
>
> Whenever the church has obtained secular power, she has employed it to punish dissent from her doctrines. Protestant churches that have followed in the steps of Rome by forming alliance with worldly powers, have manifested a similar desire to restrict liberty of conscience." (*The Great Controversy*, p. 443)

The pattern:

1. Religious bodies seek government support for their practices
2. Government endorses and promotes those practices
3. Eventually, government enforces those practices

"America Prays" represents step 2 in this progression. It establishes the precedent that government can and should promote religious activities.

**The danger:** Once government begins promoting prayer (step 2), the infrastructure exists to enforce prayer or penalize those who don't participate (step 3). The mechanism that promotes can also compel.

## II: Initiative #2 - The White House Faith Office Under Paula White-Cain

![img](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/146961682/b5aa389134c04296a687e1954a4a8aa7/eyJhIjoxLCJ3Ijo4MjB9/1.jpg?token-hash=arqZwRJPXuXkRpq9yo769vUTucylPzyFDHKWg6L7Nbg%3D&token-time=1769817600)

### What It Is

On February 8, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing the **White House Faith Office**, a newly created governmental office distinct from previous faith-based initiatives. The office was announced at the National Prayer Breakfast on February 6, 2025, and officially established two days later.

**Pastor Paula White-Cain** was appointed as **Senior Advisor and director** of the newly created White House Faith Office, returning to serve Trump's administration after her previous role in his first term (2019-2021).

**Key features of the 2025 White House Faith Office:**

- Housed within the **Domestic Policy Council** (not merely the Office of Public Liaison as in previous administrations)
- Located in the **West Wing** of the White House, indicating its elevated importance
- Consults with "experts within the faith community" and makes recommendations to the President
- Coordinates with agencies on "religious liberty training"
- Identifies and promotes grant opportunities for faith-based entities
- Works with the Attorney General to identify "failures to enforce constitutional and Federal statutory protections for religious liberty"
- **Direct policy-making authority** through Domestic Policy Council integration

### The Significance of the Structural Change

Previous administrations (Bush, Obama, Biden, and Trump's first term) had faith offices focused primarily on coordinating faith-based social services and community programs. The 2025 White House Faith Office represents a **fundamental expansion** of governmental involvement in religious matters:

**Previous model:**

- Faith office coordinated grant programs
- Liaison role between government and religious organizations
- Limited to administrative functions

**2025 model:**

- **Coordinates religious liberty training** across agencies (governmental shaping of religious understanding)
- **Works with Attorney General** on enforcement (combining religious authority with law enforcement)
- Makes policy recommendations that "align with American values" (religious leaders defining national values through government)

This is this is **religious authority integrated into the governmental policy-making apparatus**, the very definition of church-state union.

### The Prophetic Significance of Her Appointment

### Apostate Protestantism in Governmental Authority

Ellen G. White warned precisely about this development:

> "Protestants of the United States will be foremost in stretching their hands across the gulf to grasp the hand of spiritualism; they will reach over the abyss to clasp hands with the Roman power; and under the influence of this threefold union, this country will follow in the steps of Rome in trampling on the rights of conscience." (*The Great Controversy*, p. 588)

Paula White-Cain's appointment demonstrates the fulfillment of this prophecy:

**1. Spiritualism**

- Charismatic/Word of Faith theology emphasizing experiences, manifestations, and techniques
- Claims of direct revelation apart from Scripture
- Speaking in tongues, spiritual warfare, calling down angels
- Emphasis on supernatural power accessed through formulas

**2. Apostate Protestantism**

- Prosperity gospel that denies biblical Christianity's core teachings
- Rejection of suffering, sacrifice, and cross-bearing
- Focus on earthly success rather than eternal salvation
- Distortion of Scripture to support false doctrine

**3. Government Power**

- Official White House position with policy-making authority
- Integration into Domestic Policy Council
- Coordination with Attorney General on enforcement
- Access to presidential power to implement religious agenda

**All three elements, spiritualism, apostate Protestantism, and government power, converging in one office, headed by one person.**

When government appoints spiritual advisors with policy-making authority, creates offices for religious coordination integrated into the policy apparatus, and empowers religious leaders to shape law enforcement priorities, it replicates the papal model:

**Papal Rome:** Religious authority wielding civil power **The Image:** Civil authority appointing religious advisors with governmental policy-making power

Ellen G. White described exactly this scenario:

> "The 'image to the beast' represents that form of apostate Protestantism which will be developed when the Protestant churches shall seek the aid of the civil power for the enforcement of their dogmas... When the leading churches of the United States, uniting upon such points of doctrine as are held by them in common, shall influence the state to enforce their decrees and to sustain their institutions, then Protestant America will have formed an image of the Roman hierarchy, and the infliction of civil penalties upon dissenters will inevitably result." (*The Great Controversy*, p. 445)

The White House Faith Office, led by an apostate Protestant theology advocate, with authority to:

- Recommend policy changes to align with "American values" (religious values defining law)
- Coordinate "religious liberty training" across agencies (governmental enforcement of religious perspectives)
- Work with Attorney General on enforcement (religious authority directing law enforcement)
- Influence grant funding toward religious organizations (financial leverage)

**This is the infrastructure of the image to the beast being established before our eyes.**

## III. Initiative #3: The Religious Liberty Commission

![img](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/146961682/8d8efabdcb4142bf80b63a1263efab9c/eyJhIjoxLCJ3Ijo4MjB9/1.jpeg?token-hash=fjrm6D0kU4QhmxGnlHTV6L2mTenr_WnoYO46b8b-BUw%3D&token-time=1769817600)

### What It Is

The Religious Liberty Commission was established to protect religious freedom, particularly for Christians who claim their religious liberty is being violated by anti-discrimination laws, secular policies, or cultural trends.

**Stated purposes:**

- Protect religious freedom
- Defend Christians against discrimination
- Ensure religious organizations can operate according to their beliefs
- Prevent government overreach into religious matters

**Sounds good, right?** This is where the deception operates.

### The True Purpose: Establishing "Religious Liberty" to Remove Religious Liberty

George Orwell's *1984* introduced the concept of "Newspeak", language that means the opposite of what it says:

- Ministry of Truth spreads lies
- Ministry of Peace wages war
- Ministry of Love tortures dissidents

Similarly, a "Religious Liberty Commission" can be used to **destroy** religious liberty while claiming to protect it.

**How this works:**

**Step 1: Define "religious liberty" narrowly**

- Focus on protecting the religious liberty of the majority (Christians)
- Define religious liberty as the right to act on religious beliefs, even when it affects others
- Establish that Christian beliefs must be accommodated by law

**Step 2: Use "religious liberty" to justify imposing religious practices**

- Business owners refuse service based on religious beliefs
- Medical professionals deny treatment based on religious beliefs
- Employers impose religious standards on employees
- Government accommodates Christian practices in public spaces

**Step 3: Enforce religious conformity under the guise of "liberty"**

- Laws require observance of Christian practices (e.g., Sunday rest laws for "religious liberty")
- Penalties for those who don't comply (framed as protecting others' religious liberty)
- Dissent labeled as "discrimination" or "persecution" of Christians

**The result:** "Religious liberty" becomes a tool to enforce religious conformity.

Ellen G. White predicted exactly this:

> "As the defenders of truth refuse to honor the Sunday-sabbath, some of them will be thrust into prison, some will be exiled, some will be treated as slaves. To human wisdom, all this now seems impossible; but as the restraining Spirit of God shall be withdrawn from men, and they shall be under the control of Satan, who hates the divine precepts, there will be strange developments. The heart can be very cruel when God's fear and love are removed." (*The Great Controversy*, p. 608)

Ellen G. White describes the exact scenario these initiatives are building toward:

> "The dignitaries of church and state will unite to bribe, persuade, or compel all classes to honor the Sunday. The lack of divine authority will be supplied by oppressive enactments. Political corruption is destroying love of justice and regard for truth; and even in free America, rulers and legislators, in order to secure public favor, will yield to the popular demand for a law enforcing Sunday observance." (*The Great Controversy*, p. 592)

The Religious Liberty Commission establishes the governmental infrastructure to:

1. Define what constitutes legitimate religious belief and practice
2. Determine whose religious liberty deserves protection
3. Create enforcement mechanisms for "protecting" that liberty
4. Penalize those who threaten the defined religious liberty

When Sunday laws are proposed (whether for environmental, economic, or religious reasons), this commission's precedents and mechanisms will be ready to enforce them under the banner of "religious liberty."

## IV. Initiative #4: Task Force to Eradicate "Anti-Christian Bias"

![img](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/146961682/632524fbc039480c92abed5a6aedba6d/eyJhIjoxLCJwIjoxfQ%3D%3D/1.jpg?token-hash=Fj6tudQGAzyMqRI3Q2abji3J4gtBFOHIIabD8BVHOEE%3D&token-time=1769817600)

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV9R42wUnb0)

### What It Is

The Task Force to Eradicate "Anti-Christian Bias" (and similar initiatives) was established to combat perceived discrimination against Christians in American society.

**Stated purposes:**

- Identify and address anti-Christian bias in media, education, government, and culture
- Protect Christians from discrimination
- Ensure Christian perspectives are respected in public discourse
- Combat "hate speech" against Christianity

### The Dangerous Breadth of "Anti-Christian Bias"

The critical problem: **"anti-Christian bias" is an extremely broad, subjective term that can be applied to virtually any disagreement with Christian positions.**

**What might be labeled "anti-Christian bias":**

- Teaching evolution in schools
- Supporting LGBTQ+ rights
- Refusing to display religious symbols on public property
- Criticizing Christian political positions
- Advocating for secular government
- Questioning Christian privilege in society
- Keeping the seventh-day Sabbath instead of Sunday
- Refusing to participate in Sunday worship

Once government creates a task force to "eradicate" such bias, it has created an enforcement mechanism that can be weaponized against any position deemed hostile to Christianity, as defined by those in power.

### The Assault on the First Amendment

**The First Amendment guarantees:**

1. **Freedom of religion** (including freedom from religion)
2. **Freedom of speech** (including unpopular, offensive, or critical speech)
3. **Freedom of the press**
4. **Freedom of assembly**
5. **Right to petition government**

**The Bill of Rights does NOT include:**

- A right to not be offended
- A right to have your religious views honored by others
- A right to silence criticism of your beliefs
- Protection from "bias" or "hate speech"

This is intentional. The Founders understood that protecting only "acceptable" speech is not protecting free speech at all. The test of free speech is whether unpopular, offensive, or critical speech is protected.

**The concept of "hate speech" as a legal category** does not exist in American constitutional law precisely because it would be used to silence dissent. All speech is protected except:

- Direct incitement to imminent lawless action
- True threats
- Defamation
- Obscenity (narrowly defined)

"Bias" against ideas, even religious ideas, is fully protected speech.

### How "Anti-Bias" Becomes Thought Control

**The progression:**

**Step 1: Define unacceptable speech**

- "Anti-Christian bias" is identified as harmful
- Government task force investigates and documents such bias
- Social pressure builds to address the problem

**Step 2: Social consequences for "bias"**

- People expressing anti-Christian views face employment consequences
- Media outlets self-censor to avoid accusations of bias
- Educational institutions revise curricula to avoid controversy
- Public discourse shifts to accommodate Christian sensibilities

**Step 3: Legal consequences for "bias"**

- Laws prohibit speech deemed anti-Christian
- "Hate speech" laws specifically protect Christianity
- Criminal or civil penalties for expressing anti-Christian views
- Enforcement mechanisms punish violators

**Step 4: Religious conformity enforced**

- Disagreement with Christian positions becomes illegal
- Alternative religious practices suppressed as "biased" against Christianity
- Sabbath-keepers labeled as expressing "anti-Christian bias" by rejecting Sunday
- Governmental power enforces Christian religious practices

Ellen G. White describes this exact scenario:

> "As the controversy extends into new fields and the minds of the people are called to God's downtrodden law, Satan is astir. The power attending the message will only madden those who oppose it. The clergy will put forth almost superhuman efforts to shut away the light lest it should shine upon their flocks. By every means at their command they will endeavor to suppress the discussion of these vital questions." (*The Great Controversy*, p. 607)

When Sabbath truth is proclaimed, it will be labeled "anti-Christian bias" because it challenges Sunday observance. A task force empowered to "eradicate" such bias has the authority to silence Sabbath truth.

### The Orwellian Language

Notice the language: "eradicate."

Not "address" or "respond to" or "discuss"—**eradicate**. This is the language of elimination, of forcible removal, of total destruction.

What is "eradicated":

- Pests are eradicated
- Diseases are eradicated
- Enemies are eradicated

When government uses this language about ideas, beliefs, or speech, it reveals totalitarian intent.

**A government task force to "eradicate" bias is a thought police force.**

## V. The Convergence: How These Four Initiatives Work Together

![img](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/146961682/3924af2af48a4b97b740b68b4b61764a/eyJhIjoxLCJ3Ijo4MjB9/1.jpeg?token-hash=gujtnWbN42G9mK-IMQx1pJVQvIr-_fcr9HEvUSAuYZ8%3D&token-time=1769817600)

### Creating the Infrastructure of the Image to the Beast

Each initiative builds on the others to create a comprehensive system of church-state union:

**Initiative #1: "America Prays"**

- **Function:** Establishes precedent for government-promoted religious practice
- **Result:** Americans become accustomed to government coordinating religious observance
- **Next step:** Government-mandated religious observance (Sunday laws)

**Initiative #2: White House Faith Office**

- **Function:** Creates institutional structure for church-state coordination
- **Result:** Apostate Protestant theology influences government policy
- **Next step:** Official government endorsement and enforcement of specific doctrines

**Initiative #3: Religious Liberty Commission**

- **Function:** Develops legal framework for "protecting" religious practice
- **Result:** Establishes that government can define and enforce "legitimate" religious liberty
- **Next step:** Laws protecting Sunday observance as "religious liberty"

**Initiative #4: Anti-Christian Bias Task Force**

- **Function:** Creates enforcement mechanism against dissent
- **Result:** Criticism of Christian practices can be investigated and punished
- **Next step:** Sabbath-keeping labeled "anti-Christian bias" and criminalized

### This Is Not About Politics

This analysis is not about political parties, candidates, or partisan positions. The image to the beast will be formed regardless of which party holds power. Both political parties will contribute to its formation. The issue is not Republican vs. Democrat, but **church-state separation vs. church-state union**.

Ellen G. White clarifies:

> "As America, the land of religious liberty, shall unite with the papacy in forcing the conscience and compelling men to honor the false sabbath, the people of every country on the globe will be led to follow her example." (*Testimonies for the Church*, Vol. 6, p. 18)

In the face of these initiatives, God's people must:

**1. Study prophecy** - Understand the times and what we ought to do

**2. Stand for truth** - Keep all God's commandments, including the Sabbath, regardless of consequences

**3. Avoid entanglement** - Do not seek protection from or partnership with governmental religious initiatives

**4. Proclaim the warning** - Share these truths with love and urgency while time remains

**5. Prepare character** - Develop faith that will stand when all earthly supports are removed

**6. Trust God completely** - He who kept Daniel in the lion's den will keep His faithful people

May the Lord bless His people with the faith and testimony of Jesus that they may not be moved.
